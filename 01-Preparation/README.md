# Incident Response Lifecycle — Preparation Phase

This phase documents security controls implemented before incidents occur.
The goal of Preparation is to reduce attack surface, enforce policy, and
establish baseline controls that limit the impact of security events.

The labs in this phase focus on preventive and hardening measures in a
Windows enterprise environment.

## Preparation Activities Implemented
- Application execution control using AppLocker
- Centralized policy enforcement with Group Policy
- Network segmentation using VLANs
- File system security concepts using NTFS
- Operating system baseline hardening

## Why This Phase Matters
Effective preparation reduces the likelihood of incidents and limits the
blast radius when they occur. These controls help prevent unauthorized
software execution, restrict lateral movement, and improve visibility
during later detection and analysis phases.

## Lab Documentation Approach
Each lab in this phase includes:
- Scenario and security objective
- Configuration actions performed
- Why the control matters from a security perspective
- Types of incidents the control helps mitigate

This folder represents the **Preparation** phase of the Incident Response
Lifecycle. Additional phases (Detection, Analysis, Containment, Eradication,
Recovery, Lessons Learned) are documented in separate folders.
