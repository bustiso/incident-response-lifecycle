# Incident Response Lifecycle – Hands-On Labs

This repository documents hands-on cybersecurity labs mapped to the Incident Response (IR) lifecycle within a Windows enterprise environment. The goal of this project is to demonstrate how security controls, monitoring, and response activities align with each phase of incident response, using practical, real-world configurations.

The repository is structured to reflect the full IR lifecycle:
- Preparation
- Detection
- Analysis
- Containment
- Eradication
- Recovery
- Lessons Learned

Each phase contains focused labs that demonstrate specific security concepts, controls, or response actions relevant to that stage of the lifecycle.

## Scope and Focus

The current focus of this repository is the **Preparation phase**, which emphasizes proactive security measures implemented before an incident occurs. These labs demonstrate how organizations reduce risk, limit attack surfaces, and enforce security policies through preventive controls.

Preparation labs include topics such as:
- Application control and whitelisting
- Network segmentation and traffic isolation
- Operating system and file system security
- Centralized policy enforcement
- Security baseline hardening

Additional phases of the Incident Response lifecycle will be added as the project expands.
